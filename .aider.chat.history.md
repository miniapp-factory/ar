#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### dashboard about token invest ico and other informations   
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or modify this file to generate the new app logo.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A modern, flat‑style logo featuring a stylized factory silhouette in the center, with a subtle gradient from teal to blue. Above the factory, the words “Mini App Factory” are written in a clean sans‑serif font, slightly curved to follow the shape of the factory roof. The background is a light gray gradient that gives depth without distracting from the central icon. The overall composition is balanced, with the factory icon centered and the text evenly spaced below it, creating a professional yet approachable visual identity for the dashboard app.
